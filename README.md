🔍 OFFLINE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND SCAM DETECTION ENGINE
CHEATENGINE IS AN OFFLINE, SOC-GRADE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE ENGINE 
DESIGNED TO DETECT, ANALYZE, AND CLASSIFY SCAMS AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING 
ATTACKS FROM SMS, EMAILS, AND CHAT MESSAGES USING BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS, LINGUISTIC PATTERNS,
AND CONTEXT-AWARE RISK SCORING.
 
 
 🚨 PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
CYBER SCAMS VIA SMS, EMAIL, AND MESSAGING APPLICATIONS ARE INCREASING RAPIDLY.
MOST USERS AND ORGANIZATIONS FAIL TO IDENTIFY:

🎣PHISHING ATTACKS

🚔DIGITAL ARREST SCAMS

💳 FAKE REFUND AND KYC SCAMS

❤️ ROMANCE AND INVESTMENT FRAUDS

🪙 CRYPTOCURRENCY SCAMS

CHEATENGINE ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY PROVIDING AN OFFLINE,
AUTOMATED, AND INTELLIGENT SCAM ANALYSIS ENGINE.


⚙️ CORE FEATFRAUD
